# What is this?
This is my personal neovim configuration, and is a fork of [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
It is not designed for general use, and is set up for me specifically


# Installation

Run this shell command, have nvim installed already.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ZachB-AUT/kickstart.nvim.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```
